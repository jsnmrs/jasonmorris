    <h2>Hi, I&rsquo;m Jason.</h2>
    <p>There are a surprising number of folks who go by the same name. Their friends email me constantly.</p>
    <p>I wrote my first bit of HTML in a Notepad window sometime in 1998 and never stopped.</p>
    <p>Through a combination of genetics and general curiosity, I constantly tinker. Online or offline, I enjoy taking things apart, learning how they work, and (hopefully) putting them back together.</p>
    <p>This is my website. Take a peek under the hood over on <a rel="me" href="https://github.com/jsnmrs/jasonmorris">GitHub</a>.</p>
