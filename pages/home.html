    <h2 id="intro">Hi, I&rsquo;m Jason</h2>
    <p>A surprising number of folks go by the same name. Their friends email me all the time.</p>
    <p>I live in upstate New York with my <a href="https://katydecorah.com">talented significant other</a> and our 7-year-old kiddo.</p>
    <p>I’m a <a href="https://www.credly.com/badges/28c50890-24d3-4712-87e5-88d966e8685e">Certified Professional in Web Accessibility (CPWA)</a> who works as an Accessibility Engineer and Lead for Development and Digital Strategy Teams at <a href="https://communicatehealth.com/">CommunicateHealth</a>. I also tinker at <a href="https://doublegreat.dev/">doublegreat.dev</a>. I typed my first bit of HTML in a Notepad window sometime in 1998 and have been writing code ever since.</p>
    <p>Other platforms where I maintain a presence with varying degrees of participation: <a rel="me" href="https://codepen.io/jsnmrs/">CodePen</a>, <a rel="me" href="https://github.com/jsnmrs">GitHub</a>, <a rel="me" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jsnmrs/">LinkedIn</a>, <a rel="me" href="https://indieweb.social/@jasonmorris">Mastodon</a></p>
