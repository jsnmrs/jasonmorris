<p>It appears that you are offline. It&rsquo;s ok, it happens to everyone from  time to time. I created this page for this exact scenario.</p>

<p>Here are some posts you can read without being online:</p>

<ul class="chunk">
{% for post in collections.post %}
  {% if post.data.offline %}
    <li><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.data.title }}</a></li>
  {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
</ul>
