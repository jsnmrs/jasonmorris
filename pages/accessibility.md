I genuinely care about accessibility. I want this site to be usable to the widest possible audience, regardless of technology or ability. This site strives to conform with level AA of the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) as an effort toward that goal.

## Accessibility features

This site uses semantic HTML, proper landmarks, and logical heading order. It has bypass links before repetitive content and distinct focus styles. All images have text alternatives. The typeface ([Atkinson Hyperlegible](https://brailleinstitute.org/freefont)) is intended to improve legibility and readability for readers with low vision. Pages can be zoomed beyond 400% without loss of content or function. Contrast of text and UI elements is at least 4.5:1, with a goal of at least 7:1 where possible.

Every code change to this site runs through an automated [Accessibility insights for Web](https://accessibilityinsights.io/docs/web/overview/) scan before it can be published publicly. Several pages are scanned daily using [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core), [html-validate](https://html-validate.org/), with results posted automatically to [my own accessibility dashboard](https://code.jasonmorris.com/accessibility/). I explore the site occasionally with JAWS, NVDA, or VoiceOver to hear what I hope is a pleasant experience for screen reader users.
