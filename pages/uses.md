<h2 id="workspace" tabindex="-1">Workspace</h2>

This has built up over time, with trial and error and plenty selling things on eBay that didn't work for me.

<h2 id="defaults" tabindex="-1">Defaults</h2>

These are the applications I use.

[Slashpages](https://slashpages.net/#defaults) says this &ldquo;defaults&rdquo; concept came from [a Hemispheric Views podcast episode](https://listen.hemisphericviews.com/097). [A directory lists defaults pages](https://defaults.rknight.me) that others have created.
