<h1>Hey, I’m Jason.</h1>
<p>I build websites, ride bicycles, fumble with cameras, study sleep, and build my own fun.</p>

<img src="{{ site.gravatar_url }}?s=600" alt="Jason Morris" class="righten" />

<p>Additionally, I claim to be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>6′ 4″ tall</li>
  <li>A former LEGO™ maniac.</li>
  <li>A BMX and early nineties NBA trivia expert.</li>
  <li>An amateur ramp/skatepark builder.</li>
  <li>An avid non-fiction reader, whose childhood goal was to memorize the entire Guinness Book of World Records.</li>
</ul>
