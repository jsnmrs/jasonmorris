I spent the morning on a quick hike with my good friend Eric in western Massachusetts. [Cascade Falls](http://berkshirehiking.com/hikes/the_cascades.html) to be exact. Still unchecked on my photographic learning list was the infamous, dragged-shutter rushing-water photo. I had a lot of fun figuring these out.
