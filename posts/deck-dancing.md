Iâ€™m usually content shooting photos and video of other people. Sometimes I want to capture my own riding. Often that requires setting up the camera on a tripod and pressing record.

I gathered up some of those tripod clips and put together a short video. My [Least Most](https://leastmost.com/) cohort Crandall persuaded me to post online. Not the most groundbreaking maneuvers, but fun to look back on.

Besides the riding and filming, I also built every single ramp you see in this video. That includes both indoor skateparks and the backyard ramps.
