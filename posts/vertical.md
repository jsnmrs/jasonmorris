I&rsquo;ve stitched together a bunch of panoramic photos over the years. They were all horizontal, never vertical. Rather than brave the cold of February, I decided to play around with a vertical pano indoors.

Devon Swahlan threw a proper tabletop out of this quarterpipe while I experimented. The end result is a blend from 12 exposures.

A fun experiment that makes for tired scroll fingers.
