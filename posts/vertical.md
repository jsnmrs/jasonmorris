After stitching together a number of panoramic photos over the years, I realized that Iâ€™d never shot one vertically. Rather than brave the cold of February, I decided to play around with a vertical pano indoors.

Devon Swahlan was patient enough to throw a proper tabletop out of this quarter in Albany while I experimented. The end result was stitched from 12 exposures.

A fun experiment that makes for tired scroll fingers.
