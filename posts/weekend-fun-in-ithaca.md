This weekend I attended a fundraising event to help a bmx legend, Mike Tag, in his battle against cancer. I ended up shooting a [gallery of riding photos and portraits](https://leastmost.com/features/ithacas-mike-tag-benefit/) that we posted up over on the [Least Most](https://leastmost.com/). The process of getting up and down from the roof was terrifying. Word to the wise, never take advice from an inebriated Kelly Baker.
