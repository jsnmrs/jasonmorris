<p>While I&apos;m usually content shooting photos and video of other people, sometimes I feel like capturing some of my own riding. Most times that means setting up the camera on a tripod and pressing record.</p>

        <p>I gathered up some of those tripod clips and put together a quick video that my <a href="http://leastmost.com/">Least Most</a> cohort Crandall persuaded me to post online. Not the most groundbreaking maneuvers, but fun to look back on.</p>

        <p>After watching this, I realized that in addition to the riding and filming, I also built every ramp you&apos;ll see in this video. Sometimes you have to take things into your own hands.</p>
