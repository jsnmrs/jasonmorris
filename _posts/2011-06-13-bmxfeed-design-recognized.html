<p>I spotted this link while looking at Google Analytics for <a href="http://bmxfeed.com">BMXfeed</a>. Joshua Jackson over at <a href="http://designshack.net/">Design Shack</a> wrote an article, <a href="http://designshack.net/articles/css/20-amazing-examples-of-using-media-queries-for-responsive-web-design"><em>20 Amazing Examples of Using Media Queries for Responsive Web Design</em></a> and to my surprise, BMXfeed was included in that list. BMXfeed has been listed over on the <a href="http://mediaqueri.es/bmx/">mediaqueri.es</a> site as well. I appreciate the mention!</p>
