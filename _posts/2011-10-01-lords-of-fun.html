<p>I was fortunate enough to have a few photos published in issue 2 of <a href="http://thealbion.cc/">Albion Magazine</a> a little while back. I went on a road trip from Richmond, Virginia to the Outer Banks of North Carolina in a caravan including a green limousine and about a dozen motorcycles. <a href="http://vimeo.com/32484086">Propsbmx.tv</a> filmed the entire trip and we posted a bunch of <a href="http://leastmost.com/features/lords-of-fun-2-photos/">photos over on Least Most</a>, too.</p>

<p>One of the photos that ended up in the magazine was this snap of my buddy Steve cruising down the highway in NC.</p>
