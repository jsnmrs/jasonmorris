I was fortunate enough to have a few photos published in issue 2 of Albion Magazine a little while back. I went on a road trip from Richmond, Virginia to the Outer Banks of North Carolina in a caravan including a green limousine and about a dozen motorcycles. [Propsbmx.tv](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSkOfBU5ju0) filmed the entire trip and we posted a bunch of [photos over on Least Most](https://leastmost.com/features/lords-of-fun-2-photos/), too.

One of the photos that ended up in the magazine was this snap of my buddy Steve cruising down the highway in NC.
