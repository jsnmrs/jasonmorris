<p>This weekend I headed out to Ithaca, New York for a fundraising event to help a bmx legend, Mike Tag, in his battle against cancer. I ended up shooting a <a href="http://leastmost.com/features/ithacas-mike-tag-benefit/">gallery of riding photos and portraits</a> that we posted up over on the <a href="http://leastmost.com/">Least Most</a>. The process of getting up and down from the roof was terrifying. Word to the wise, never take advice from an inebriated Kelly Baker.</p>
