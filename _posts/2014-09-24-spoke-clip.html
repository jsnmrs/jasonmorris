<p>Instructions for replacing fork seal clips on a 1982 Suzuki GS850L motorcycle:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Stare at recently removed, broken, and rusted fork clips.</li>
  <li>Determine that rebuilding your forks cannot continue until new clips are procured.</li>
  <li>Google &ldquo;<a href="//www.google.com/#q=1982+Suzuki+GS850L+fork+seal+clips)">1982 Suzuki GS850L fork seal clips</a>&rdquo;.</li>
  <li>Decide that ordering the part online will not yield same day delivery.</li>
  <li>Think.</li>
  <li>Travel to local bicycle shop and ask for two 15 gauge spokes.</li>
  <li>Endure guarded response to request, followed by questions regarding application.</li>
  <li>Convince bicycle shop employee that you are indeed worthy of paying for two spokes.</li>
  <li>Return to the garage with two spokes, six dollars poorer.</li>
  <li>Trace existing fork clip onto a piece of paper, improvising the sections that have dissolved over the course of 30 years.</li>
  <li>Take two sets of needle nose pliers and begin bending bicycle spokes into the octagonal shape of the factory part.</li>
  <li>As shaping progresses, refer to paper tracing to ensure proper dimensions.</li>
  <li>Cut excess spoke end and spoke head using a pair of <a href="//www.parktool.com/product/professional-cable-and-housing-cutter-cn-10">Park Tools CN-10 cable cutters</a>.</li>
  <li>Again, confirm appropriate shape.</li>
  <li>Remark to self that the stainless steel spoke will not rust in the same fashion as the factory part and grin sheepishly.</li>
  <li>Insert newly minted fork clip into fork leg using a small screwdriver.</li>
  <li>Hear the satisfying click of the clip seating itself into the fork leg&rsquo;s clip groove.</li>
  <li>Excitedly repeat the fabrication process for the clip for the other fork leg.</li>
  <li>Click.</li>
</ol>

<p>Job well done.</p>
