<p>In Fort Edward, New York, Niles Harris has a mini ramp in his parents&rsquo; barn. We had been talking about shooting a quick video of Niles riding his ramp for months, so one afternoon I made the drive north to give it a swing. We spent a few hours filming without much of a plan.</p>

        <p>At one point, I thought that an overhead shot would look great, so I walked out on an exposed beam situated over one side of the ramp. Partially across I looked down to the barn floor, thirteen feet below and froze. Usually, heights donâ€™t bother me, but the balance needed for the narrow beam while holding my camera spooked me. I continued out to grab onto an upright beam for support and filmed a few shots before scurrying back to safety. Lesson learned.</p>
