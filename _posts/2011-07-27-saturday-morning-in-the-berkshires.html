<p>I spent the morning on a quick hike with my good friend Eric, just over the New York border in Massachusetts. <a href="http://berkshirehiking.com/hikes/the_cascades.html">Casade Falls</a> to be exact. Still unchecked on my photographic learning list was the infamous, dragged-shutter rushing-water photo. I had a lot of fun figuring these out.</p>
