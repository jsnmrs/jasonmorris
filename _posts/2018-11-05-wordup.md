I built this tool called [Wordup](https://communicatehealth.github.io/wordup/) to convert content from Word documents into HTML or Markdown.

It uses the built-in paste tools of [CKEditor 4](https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-4/) and sprinkles in some extra vanilla JS for whitespace reduction and string replacement to spit out clean HTML. Check a box and [Turndown.js](https://github.com/domchristie/turndown) converts to Markdown.

But converting Word documents to HTML is a solved problem, right?

1. Search for "Word to HTML conversion"
1. Search for "Word to _clean_ HTML conversion"
1. Consider pasting Word document contents into mystery text boxes on several online conversion tools
1. Wonder how these tools actually work
1. Wonder where my content will be sent off to
1. Close browser, open Word document
1. Copy content, paste into text editor
1. Begin wrapping text in HTML tags
1. Give up
1. Open Word document, save as HTML
1. Open HTML in text editor
1. Cry a little
1. Start using find and replace to remove extra markup
1. Graduate to regex searches
1. Eventually arrive at relatively clean HTML
1. Realize that you've been sent an updated version of the Word document while working through steps 1-15
1. Cry a little

WYSIWYG editors in most CMS platforms deal with pasting Word documents, right?

1. Search for JavaScript-based WYSIWYG editors
1. Pick one
1. Create a HTML page with two `<textarea>` fields
1. Hook WYSIWYG editor into first `<textarea>`
1. Read documentation
1. Figure out how to get converted text out of WYSIWYG `<textarea>` and into second `<textarea>` as HTML
1. Notice _converted_ HTML still needs some love
1. Write additional whitespace and string replacement rules to send converted text through
1. End up with really clean HTML in the second `<textarea>`
1. Cry a little
1. Wonder what else you can do
1. Add markdown conversion and link helpers
1. Tell people about it
