<p>It appears that you are offline. It's ok, it happens to everyone from time to time. I created this page specifically for this scenario.</p>

<p>Here are two posts you can read without being online:</p>

<ul>
{% for post in site.posts %}
  {% if post.offline %}
    <li>
      <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
    </li>
  {% endif %}
{% endfor %}
</ul>
